# mc-automated-properties
An "automated" way to handle modded blocks/items and generate `.properties` files.

# What is this?
This is two things
1. A library of json files with clean info on vanilla & modded blocks
2. A python script that translates those json files into `items.properties`, `blocks.properties`, and `entity.properties` for the [Photon shaderpack](https://modrinth.com/shader/photon-shader) (and maybe others? didn't really check)

Together these two things allow for MUCH faster integration of modded blocks into your shaderpack configuration files ;)

# Which mods are supported?
Simply check out the [list of json files](https://github.com/Allexio/mc-automated-properties/tree/main/input-jsons) available on this github

# How to use
1. clone the repo,
2. go inside the downloaded folder, in the `input-jsons` folder,
3. remove all the `.json` files for mods you are not using,
4. run `main.py` with python (pretty standard nowadays, if you don't have python, you'll have to [download it](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
5. normally this should have generated three files: `block.properties`, `entity.properties` and `item.properties`
6. download and unzip your shaderpack (once again this is meant to work with [Photon](https://modrinth.com/shader/photon-shader) only, I do not know how other shaderpacks handle this)
7. replace the `block.properties`, `item.properties` and `entity.properties` inside the shaderpack with the ones that were generated by this tool
8. rezip the shaderpack and place it in your `shaderpacks` folder.

Profit!

# How to help
1. clone the repo
2. go look at what I did for the `chipped.json` file, it should be pretty easy to understand. The description field doesn't matter, it is only there to help you know what to put inside.
3. copy one of the json files, (can start from whichever)
4. rename the file to the name of the mod
5. start working on adding custom blocks and items to your new `[mod].json` file. You do not need to add the mod id in the block names, just the block id.
6. when you're done, send it to me on discord (I'll credit you in the commit) or do a PR to add it directly on github

Thank you!
