# mc-automated-properties
An "automated" way to handle modded blocks/items and import information into block.properties &amp; item.properties files.

# How to use
1. clone the repo,
2. go inside the downloaded folder,
3. remove all the jsons for mods you are not using,
4. run main.py
5. move the generated block.properties file and item.properties to wherever you need them

Profit!

# How to help
1. clone the repo
2. go look at what I did for the chipped.json file, it should be pretty easy to understand. The description field doesn't matter, it is only there to help you know what to put inside.
3. copy one of the json files, (can start from whichever)
4. rename the file **to the id of the mod** for example for chipped, the items are called `chipped:xxxxitem` so the file should be named `chipped.json`
5. start working on adding custom blocks and items
6. when you're done, send it to me on discord (I'll credit you in the commit) or do a PR to add it directly on github

Thank you!
